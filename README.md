This PDF includes the mathematical justification for using convex optimization to resolve the Logistic Regression Problem as well as the theory underlying logistic regression. It has code examples for creating a logistic regression model with cvxpy and classifying a set of randomly generated points linearly. We also use this on a dataset from the actual world that deals with predicting heart disease based on several variables like blood pressure and cholesterol.
